# Competitive CS2 in Oceania: The DFRAG Path to Pro

Counter-Strike 2 in Oceania requires a strong grassroots foundation and the need for a circuit that allows teams to compete against the very best as often as possible.  

As announced in August, **DFRAG is committed to ensuring the future of the OCE CS2 scene remains bright.** Today, we're detailing exactly what the new OCE path to pro will look like for 2025 and the start of 2026 via the DFRAG circuit.  

At its core, this new circuit is built upon the **DFRAG Open Series**: a multi-stage online event and broadcast that takes place over several weekends and is free for all teams to enter.  

**Up for grabs:** cash prizes, Valve Ranking System (VRS) points, invitations to DFRAG LAN events, and more — all designed so our best and brightest in Oceania have a clear path forward in the new world of competitive CS2 esports.
