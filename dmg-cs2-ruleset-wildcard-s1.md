### Respectful Conduct

### Competitive Integrity

### Professionalism

Participants are representatives of the community. Any conduct bringing the tournament, organiser, or sponsors into disrepute (in-game or publicly on social media) may result in disciplinary action.

### Enforcement

Breaches of sportsmanship are subject to immediate review by tournament officials. Penalties range from warnings and round losses to match forfeits, prize forfeiture, suspensions, or permanent bans, as deemed appropriate under [Penalties](#penalties).
